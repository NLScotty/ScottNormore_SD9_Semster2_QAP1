        <article>
            <h2>Species Traits</h2>
            <p>The Western Honey is an Arthropod (Insect) that is roughly 12 to 16 mm. They have the traits most arthropods have; six legs and antennae. They are golden yellow/brown colored and have a pair of wings. The western honey bee also have Hairy eyes and a cell like pattern on their wings. [1]</p>
            <h2>History of Western Honey Bees to Humans</h2>
            <p>Not native to the western hemisphere, the “Western Honey Bee” has been imported by early European Colonists in 1622. It has been believed that the honey bee originated from Africa or Asia [1]. The honey bee is one of the first insects domesticated by humankind; a practice known as bee keeping. The practice of bee keeping has been estimated to have started roughly 15000 years ago, with evidence of beekeeping that comes from Egyptian records as early 3000 BC. [2]</p>

            <h2>Life of the Honey Bee</h2>
            <p>What a bee does during the life is determined by what kind of bee it is. There are three different kinds of bees; worker bees (the majority), drones, and a queen bee. Worker bees are responsible for pollinating and finding food. Queen and drone bees are responsible for maintaining the nest and reproducing. [3]</p>
            <p>The diet of the honey bees consist of nectar (sugar and stuff) and pollen. In particular, pollen is used to feed the larvae (baby) of the bees. [1]</p>
            <p>Both Worker and Drone bees have a very short life span. Workers tend to only live for a few weeks but are able to live for a few months if the hive becomes dormant during the winter. Drones live even shorter lives; 4-8 weeks maximum. Queen bees on the other hand average about 2-3 years, with potential to live up to 5 years.</p>
            <h2>Importance of Bees to Humans</h2>
            <P>One of the most important things that honey bees provide to humans is the pollination of plants. Pollination is the act of transferring the pollen from a male insect to a female plant. They do this when looking for pollen to eat. This act allows the plant to create seeds; allowing for more plants to grow. [4] Honey bees are responsible for pollinating 30% of the food we eat. [3]</P>
            <P>In addition to pollination, honey bees also provide wax, jelly, and of course: Honey! [3]</P>

            <h2>A close cousin: the African Honey Bee</h2>
            <p>Closely related to the Western Honey Bee is the African Honey Bee. This cousin is also has earned the common name of “The Killer Bee”. While individually it is no more harmful than the normal Honey Bee, it is referred to as the Killer Bee due to its more aggressive behavior. A large factor in its heightened aggressiveness comes from the ability to sting multiple times with its stinger vs the Western Honey Bee who is able only to sting once before losing its stinger. [5]</p>
            <p>It is worth noting that the honey bee and the African killer bee are very similar in appearance; only really different in wing size. [5]</p>
            <p>While more aggressive and less desirable, African Honey Bees are still important due to their ability to pollinate plant life.</p>

            <h2 class="center">Listen to bees "buzz"</h2>
            <p> The "buzzing" sound of bees come from bees flapping their wings at high speeds. They can flap their wings at a very impressive 230 beats per second! This flapping causes the air around the bee to vibrate, making the buzzing sound that we hear from bees.[6] Use the Audio Sample below to listen to the buzz!</p>
